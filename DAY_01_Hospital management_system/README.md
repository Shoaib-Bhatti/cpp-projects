🏥 Hospital Management System – Project 1 of 90  
> “Every great developer was once a beginner who dared to take the first step.”

---

## 🧩 Overview  
Day 1 of my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge** begins with something practical — a **Hospital Management System** 🏥.  
This project is designed to organize and manage hospital data efficiently. It handles patients, doctors, and appointments in one simple console-based interface.  

It gave me a great start — from handling **classes and objects** in C++ to working with **file storage**, **validation**, and **menu-driven logic**.  
This project feels like a real-world mini system for clinics or small hospitals!

## ⚡ Features  
✅ Add and view **Patient Records**  
✅ Add and view **Doctor Profiles** with specialization  
✅ Book **Appointments** between patients and doctors  
✅ Save all records (Patients, Doctors, Appointments) to **text files**  
✅ Option to **clear all data files** (password protected 🔐)  
✅ Search doctors by **specialization** before booking appointments  
✅ Clean and interactive **menu system** for easy navigation

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. Run the program — you’ll get a full-featured menu.  
2. Add patient and doctor information first.  
3. Book appointments by selecting patients and matching doctors.  
4. You can view, save, or clear data anytime.  
5. All records are stored in text files (`patients.txt`, `doctors.txt`, `appointments.txt`) for later access.  
6. To clear data, use the admin password (`admin123`).

## 🧠 Example Workflow  
**Step 1:** Add a few patients and doctors 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️  
**Step 2:** Use the “Book Appointment” option to connect them  
**Step 3:** Save your data in files for record keeping  
**Step 4:** Access or clear the files as needed — all from one place!  

It’s simple but feels surprisingly powerful when everything connects together.

## 🗓️ Journal (Day 1)  
This was my very first project in the challenge, and it felt *so rewarding*!  
I learned how to manage multiple entities in C++, link them logically, and store them safely in files.  

It taught me the importance of **data relationships**, **input validation**, and **system design thinking** — the real foundation of programming logic.  
The idea of managing hospital data with pure C++ made me realize how creative programming can be.  

---

## 🚀 Next Step Ideas  
- Add a **search bar** to find patients or doctors by name  
- Show appointments by **specific date**  
- Add a **file loading system** so saved data can be reused on restart  
- Build a **GUI version** using C++ with Qt or Python Tkinter  
- Connect it with a database (MySQL or SQLite) for real-world use

## 🌟 Final Note  
Every line of this project was a small step toward becoming a better developer.  
It reminded me that real learning starts when you build things that **solve real problems**.  

This Hospital Management System may look simple — but for me, it’s a symbol of **where everything began** in my 90-day journey. 💻❤️
