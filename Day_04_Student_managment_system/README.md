# 🧑‍🎓 Student Management System – Project 4 of 90

Hi! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, a 17-year-old CS student chasing my 90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge.  
Today, I decided to work on something close to every student’s life —  
a **Student Management System** 🎓  

I wanted to make a system that feels like what schools or small institutes actually use —  
to **add, view, search, and sort students easily** without any confusion.

---

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- ➕ Add new students  
- 👀 View all students  
- 🔍 Search by Roll Number  
- 📊 Sort students by marks (Highest to Lowest)  
- 💾 Save and load data from a file (no data loss after closing)  

---

🛠️ **How It Works (Simple Version)**  
When the program starts, it loads student data from a file named `students.txt`.  
Each menu option performs a real-life action:  

- **Add Student:** Enter Roll No, Name, Class, and Marks → saved in memory.  
- **View All Students:** Displays all records neatly.  
- **Search Student:** Type a Roll Number and instantly get their info.  
- **Sort by Marks:** Helps teachers find toppers easily.  
- **Save Data:** Everything written to file automatically for next time.  

💡 *Behind the scenes:*  
The system uses **classes**, **vectors**, and **file handling** —  
the real backbone of C++ projects that manage data smoothly.

📝 **My Journal – Day 4**

I’m still on my journey — learning step by step, and loving every part of it. 💻  
This project taught me that managing data is not hard when you keep things organized.  

Sorting by marks made the system feel **real** — like something schools could actually use.  
Seeing data stay after closing the program felt magical, like saving progress in a game 🎮  

It’s simple, but it’s progress — and that’s all that matters.

🚀 **Next Step Ideas**
- 🧮 Add GPA calculator  
- 🗂️ Add class-wise reports  
- 🔐 Add admin login for teacher access  

---

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 4/90**,  
and it reminded me why I started this challenge —  
not just to build programs, but to build *confidence*.  

One more project down.  
Learning never stops. 🔥
