# 🎓 GPA & CGPA Calculator – Project 17 of 90

> "Don’t just chase grades — chase understanding. The grades will follow."

---

## 🧩 Overview
This project is a **GPA and CGPA Calculator** made to help university students easily calculate their semester GPA or overall CGPA.  
It’s like a small academic assistant that helps you understand your progress without doing manual calculations!  
You can calculate either **GPA** for one semester or **CGPA** for multiple semesters — and it guides you every step of the way.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Choose between **GPA** or **CGPA** calculation  
✅ Automatically shows **letter grades (A, B+, B-, etc.)** with grade points  
✅ Accepts **credit hours** for accurate GPA calculation  
✅ Calculates **overall CGPA** based on previous semesters  
✅ Tells you if you need to first find your semester GPAs  
✅ Clean and beginner-friendly console interface

## 🧠 How It Works
When the program starts, it asks:
> Do you want to calculate GPA or CGPA?

### 🧾 If you choose GPA:
It will ask:
- How many subjects you have  
- For each subject:  
  - Credit hours  
  - Marks obtained  
  - Total marks  

Then it shows your **grade (A, B+, etc.)** and **grade point (like 3.7, 4.0)** for each subject.  
After all entries, it calculates and displays your **GPA for the semester**.

### 📊 If you choose CGPA:
It will ask:
- How many semesters you’ve completed  
- GPA of each semester  

Then it calculates and displays your **overall CGPA**.  
If you don’t know your GPA yet, it tells you to calculate it first before continuing.

## 📔 Journal (Day 17)

**Day 17 of my 90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge 🚀**

Today’s project was made for every student who wants a quick and reliable way to calculate GPA and CGPA.  
It helped me understand how grading systems work and how to handle multiple user inputs logically.

🎯 **What I learned:**
- Handling multiple calculations using loops  
- Using conditions to assign grades  
- Building logic step by step  

💪 **Motivational Thought:**
> “Every small project you build is proof that you’re becoming better each day.”

## 💭 Next Step Ideas
- Add saving of GPA results to a text file  
- Create a GUI version using C++ or Python  
- Add an option for different grading scales  
- Build a web-based version for students

## 🏁 Final Note
This project reminded me that even simple tools can save time and help students.  
Coding is not just about syntax — it’s about **creating solutions** that make life easier.  
One more project completed, one step closer to mastery 🚀
