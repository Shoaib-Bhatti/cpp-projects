# 🌡️ Temperature Converter System – Project 10 of 90

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, an 18-year-old CS student on my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After building my Length Converter yesterday, I wanted to go one step further — something that’s still simple but feels a bit more *scientific*.  

So, I created a **Temperature Converter System** — a beginner-friendly program that quickly converts between **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin**.  
It’s a small project, but it shows how easy it is to make something that actually *feels useful*.

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- 🔁 Convert **Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit**  
- 🔁 Convert **Celsius ↔ Kelvin**  
- 🔁 Convert **Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin**  
- 🧭 Easy menu-driven system for beginners  
- 💾 Realistic conversion formulas (just like your science class!)

🛠️ **How It Works (Simple & Clear)**
When the program starts, it shows a clean **menu** with options to choose which conversion you want.  
You enter your choice, type the temperature value, and get an instant result.

Example options:
1️⃣ Celsius → Fahrenheit  
2️⃣ Fahrenheit → Celsius  
3️⃣ Celsius → Kelvin  
4️⃣ Kelvin → Celsius  
5️⃣ Fahrenheit → Kelvin  
6️⃣ Kelvin → Fahrenheit  
7️⃣ Exit  

Behind the scenes, the program uses **simple math formulas**:
- Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32  
- Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) × 5/9  
- Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15  

No loops or vectors — just pure, clean logic for beginners to understand conversion step by step.

📝 **My Journal – Day 10**

Today’s project made me appreciate how *math and programming* go hand in hand.  
Writing formulas in code feels like turning equations into living instructions.  

I kept the logic as simple as possible so anyone new to C++ can understand it easily.  
And honestly, watching it give correct results felt surprisingly fun 😄  

Every small project like this strengthens my problem-solving skills and helps me write cleaner code each time.

🚀 **Next Step Ideas**
- ⚖️ Add a weight converter (grams ↔ kilograms ↔ pounds)  
- ⏱️ Add a time converter (hours ↔ minutes ↔ seconds)  
- 💡 Combine all converters into one “Mega Converter” system

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 10/90**, and I’m happy with it.  
It’s not about the size of the code — it’s about how *clearly* it teaches you something new.  

Each day I build, I learn — and that’s what this challenge is really about.  
Consistency, curiosity, and creativity — all in one journey.
