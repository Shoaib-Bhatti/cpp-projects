# 🔑 Password Strength Checker – Project 3 of 90  

Hi! My name is **Shoaib Nazar**, I’m a 17-year-old CS student who’s passionate about programming.  
I’ve started a **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**, and this is my **third project**.  
I’m documenting each step, not just what I built, but how it really works.

## 🌟 What This Program Can Do  
- 📝 **Takes a password as input**  
- 🔍 **Scans every character**  
- ✅ Checks for **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols**  
- 📊 **Gives strength rating** → Weak ❌ / Medium ⚠️ / Strong ✅  

---

## 🛠️ How the Code Works (Simple Explanation)  
- The program asks you to type a password.  
- Using a **loop**, it checks each character:  
  - Uppercase → stronger  
  - Lowercase → stronger  
  - Digit → stronger  
  - Special symbol → stronger  
- It assigns a **score** and finally shows the password’s strength.  

🔧 **Behind the scenes:** Functions from the **`<cctype>` library** like `isupper`, `islower`, `isdigit`, and `isalnum` make the checks easy.

## 📝 My Journal – Day 3  
I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, and today I realized how small ideas can teach **big lessons**.  

This project looked simple, but it forced me to understand **strings, loops, and character checking** at a deeper level. It felt like writing a mini security system.  

Every project I build gives me a little more confidence. Day by day, I’m turning from just “learning C++” into **thinking like a programmer**.

## 🚀 What’s Next  
- 🖊️ Show **tips to improve weak passwords**  
- 📁 Save passwords in a file (encrypted)  
- 🔒 Add a **real-time checker** while typing

## 🎯 Final Note  
This was **Project 3/90**.  
The goal isn’t to write perfect code but to **keep moving forward**.  
Consistency is my weapon.  

By **Day 90**, I don’t just want projects — I want proof that **discipline beats motivation**.  

✨ *“The password to success is showing up every single day.”* ✨
