# ⚖️ BMI Converter System – Project 14 of 90

> "Small steps daily lead to a stronger and healthier version of you."

---

## 🧩 Overview
Welcome to **Day 14** of my 90-day coding journey!  
Today, I built a **BMI Converter System** using **C++** — a simple yet meaningful project that calculates a person’s **Body Mass Index** based on their **weight and height**.  

It’s a fun way to learn how **basic math formulas**, **if-else conditions**, and **user inputs** work together to create a real-life health calculator.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Takes **weight (kg)** and **height (m)** from the user  
- Calculates **BMI** instantly  
- Displays the **BMI category** — Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to expand later  

---

## 🧮 Formula Used
\[
BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2}
\]

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to handle user input  
- How to apply mathematical formulas in C++  
- How to use **if-else conditions** for real-world logic  

---

## 🏁 Journal (Day 14)
Today’s project reminded me that coding is like fitness — both need **consistency and patience**.  
Each small project strengthens my foundation and confidence a little more.

---

## 💡 Next Step Ideas
- Add unit options (feet/pounds)  
- Store BMI results in a file  
- Add advice based on the BMI result  

---

## ✨ Final Note
I’m proud of how far I’ve come — 14 days down, 76 to go!  
Let’s keep pushing and growing stronger, one project at a time. 💪
