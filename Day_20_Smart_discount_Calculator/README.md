## 🧠 How It Works
- The user inputs the **original price** and **discount percentage**.  
- The system calculates the **discounted price** using:  
  \[
  \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \left(\frac{\text{Discount%}}{100} \times \text{Original Price}\right)
  \]  
- The program also calculates the **amount saved** and allows the user to optionally add a **tax percentage**.

## 🧭 Journal (Day 20)
Today’s project was all about **making math feel useful in real life**.  
I built a program that helps anyone quickly figure out the *real* cost after discounts — no calculator needed!  
It made me understand how simple percentage formulas can be turned into something genuinely helpful.  

💬 *Lesson learned:* Even small ideas can be powerful when they solve a real-world problem.

## 🚀 Next Step Ideas
- Add currency symbols selection (USD, PKR, EUR).  
- Let the user compare **two discounts** to see which saves more.  
- Add a “bulk shopping mode” to calculate discounts for multiple products.
