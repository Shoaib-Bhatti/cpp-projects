# 🏎️ Speed Converter System – Project 16 of 90  

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, an 18-year-old CS student continuing my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After working on a Currency Converter, I wanted to create something more *scientific* — something that connects with physics, vehicles, and real-life motion.  

So I built this **Speed Converter System**, a simple yet effective C++ program that converts between various speed units like **m/s**, **km/h**, **mph**, and **ft/s**.  
It’s one of those projects that feel both practical and fun to test — especially if you love cars or just want to see numbers change in real time.

## 🧩 Overview  

This system helps convert speed values between **different global units** used in vehicles, physics, and sports.  
It’s beginner-friendly and built entirely using **switch statements**, **loops**, and **basic arithmetic**.  

By working on this, I learned how math and programming blend together to solve real-world conversion problems.

## 🌟 Features  

- 🔁 Convert **Meters/Second ↔ Kilometers/Hour**  
- 🔁 Convert **Meters/Second ↔ Miles/Hour**  
- 🔁 Convert **Kilometers/Hour ↔ Miles/Hour**  
- 🔁 Convert **Meters/Second ↔ Feet/Second**  
- 🧮 Uses accurate mathematical formulas for real-world accuracy  
- 🧭 Clean, menu-based interface for easy navigation

## ⚙️ How It Works  

When you run the program, it displays a **menu** with 8 options.  
You pick the desired conversion, enter your value, and instantly get the converted result.  

It uses simple formulas like:  
- `km/h = m/s × 3.6`  
- `m/s = km/h ÷ 3.6`  
- `mph = km/h ÷ 1.60934`  
- `m/s = mph ÷ 2.23694`  

No files, no complexity — just logic, clarity, and clean output.

## 📝 My Journal – Day 16  

Today’s project reminded me how programming and science connect perfectly.  
While building this, I realized every small line of code carries real-world meaning —  
it’s not just numbers, it’s *motion, distance, and time working together.*  

The process was smooth, but testing it with different values felt surprisingly satisfying.  
It’s another small reminder that **simple projects can teach powerful lessons** if you think beyond the syntax.

## 🚀 Next Step Ideas  

- 🧭 Add more conversions like knots or Mach (airplane speed)  
- 📊 Add a graphical display showing how units compare  
- 💾 Save recent conversions to a file

## 🎯 Final Note  

This was **Project 16/90**, and it pushed me to blend logic, science, and creativity together.  
I’m realizing that learning programming isn’t about rushing — it’s about **building understanding one project at a time.**  

The more I create, the faster I grow — not just in code, but in clarity.
