# 🧠 Quiz Game System – Project 7 of 90

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, a 17-year-old CS student currently working through my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After creating tools that organize data and track expenses, I wanted to make something fun — something that tests your brain while teaching logic.  

So, I built a **Quiz Game System** — a simple question-based program that checks your answers and gives you a score at the end.  
It’s a small project, but it perfectly combines **logic**, **loops**, and **decision-making** in C++.

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- Ask multiple-choice questions  
- Check your answers instantly  
- Keep track of your score  
- Display your result at the end  
- Easy to edit and expand with new questions  

---

🛠️ **How It Works (Simple Explanation)**
When you run the program, it shows you one question at a time.  
For each question, you select an answer (1–4).  
At the end, it shows your score and gives feedback like “Excellent!” or “Try Again!”  

💡 *Behind the scenes:*  
It uses basic **if-else statements**, **variables**, and **loops** to check answers — making it perfect for beginners learning how programs make decisions.

📝 **My Journal – Day 7**

Today, I decided to step away from management systems and build something that feels like a game.  
This project reminded me why I love coding — instant feedback and small wins.  

It might look simple, but it taught me how programs interact with users step-by-step.  
Each condition, each answer — it all connects together like puzzle pieces.  

Every time I build something new, I realize how much I’ve improved — not just in writing code, but in **thinking like a programmer**.

🚀 **What’s Next**
- Add more questions and levels  
- Show percentage or grade at the end  
- Save high scores to a file  
- Add random question selection

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 7/90**, and it was one of the most enjoyable so far.  
Because coding shouldn’t always be serious — sometimes, it should make you smile.  

Every day, every project, I’m learning how to turn simple ideas into real programs.  
One line of code at a time, I’m growing stronger as a programmer.
