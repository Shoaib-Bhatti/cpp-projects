# 🚗 Car Rental System – Project 5 of 90

Hey there! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, a 17-year-old CS student working on my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After managing students and books, I wanted to build something that feels more *real-world practical*.  
So today , I built a **Car Rental System** 🚘  

It’s small, clean, and functional — something you could actually use in a local car agency.

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- ➕ Add new cars  
- 👀 View all available cars  
- 🚙 Rent a car (marked as unavailable)  
- 🔁 Return a rented car  
- 💰 Sort cars by rent price (low to high)  
- 💾 Save and load data from a text file  

---

🛠️ **How It Works (Simple & Clear)**  
The system runs through a simple **menu interface** —  
you just pick a number and perform an action.  

- **Add Car:** ID → Name → Model → Rent per day  
- **View Cars:** Shows everything neatly with status (Available/Rented)  
- **Rent Car:** Enter Car ID → system marks it unavailable  
- **Return Car:** Enter Car ID again → available again  
- **Sort by Price:** Shows cars from cheapest to most expensive 🚗💨  

💡 *Under the hood:*  
All cars are stored inside a **vector** (dynamic list).  
**File handling** keeps your data safe in `cars.txt`,  
so you never lose anything after closing the program.

📝 **My Journal – Day 5**

Honestly, this project made me think about how **real businesses** handle their data.  
Renting, returning, availability — it’s all about **tracking smartly**.  

When I added the sorting feature, it suddenly felt like a real app —  
like something you’d see in a small car rental office dashboard.  

It was short, fun, and gave me another level of confidence in file handling.  
Each project feels like a new puzzle, and I love solving it 🧩

🚀 **Next Step Ideas**
- 🧾 Add customer details (name, phone, rented car)  
- 📊 Add income report  
- 🔐 Add login system for admin

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 5/90**,  
and the journey just keeps getting better.  

It’s not about big results — it’s about small wins every day.  
I’m learning how to make real things, one line of code at a time 💻✨
