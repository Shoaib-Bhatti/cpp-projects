# ⏳ Pomodoro Timer – Project 18 of 90

## 🧩 Overview  
Welcome to **Day 18** of my *90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge*!  
Today, I built a **Pomodoro Timer System** — a simple yet powerful productivity tool designed to help people focus better.  

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where you work in focused intervals (usually 25 minutes), followed by short breaks. After completing four rounds, you take a longer break. It’s scientifically proven to help you stay more consistent and avoid burnout.  

This project gave me hands-on experience with **loops, sleep functions, time formatting, and countdown timers** in C++. I learned how to make the console feel “alive” — as the seconds ticked by on screen, I could literally feel the focus building.

## 🪶 Journal (Day 18)  
Today’s project reminded me of the **power of consistency**.  
When I started this timer, it was just counting seconds — but by the end, I realized that those seconds represent focus, effort, and growth.  

I also learned about the `std::this_thread::sleep_for` and `std::chrono` library in C++. Watching the console refresh every second made me feel like I was coding something *alive*. It’s simple, yet it gives the satisfaction of real interaction.  

It also showed me how easy it is to lose focus — and how powerful it feels to take charge of your time again.  

💭 *Lesson of the Day:* Time will pass anyway — so make it pass in your favor.

## 💡 Next Step Ideas  
🕹️ Add a **pause/resume** feature to the timer  
🔔 Add a **sound notification** when time’s up  
🧮 Display total focus time of the day  
📊 Store session logs in a `.txt` file to track progress  
🎯 Build a GUI version in the future using Qt or SFML

## 🌟 Final Note  
Every Pomodoro session might look small — just a few minutes —  
but together they form the hours, the discipline, and the focus that build your dreams.

Keep showing up, stay consistent, and trust the process. ⏳🔥
