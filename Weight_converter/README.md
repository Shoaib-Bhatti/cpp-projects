# ⚖️ Weight Converter System – Project 11 of 90

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, an 18-year-old CS student on my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After completing my Temperature Converter, I wanted to continue exploring real-life converters —  
so today, I built a **Weight Converter System** in C++!

This project is all about understanding **unit conversions** and how simple logic can create powerful results.  
It’s beginner-friendly, practical, and teaches how formulas come alive through code.

---

## 🧩 Overview
This **Weight Converter System** lets users convert between **kilograms, grams, pounds, and ounces** effortlessly.  
By using menus and simple math formulas, I learned how to handle **user input**, **basic calculations**, and **switch-case structures** effectively.  

This project made me realize how everyday tools — like a weight calculator — are just a few lines of logic written smartly.

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- 🔁 Convert **Kilograms ↔ Grams**  
- 🔁 Convert **Kilograms ↔ Pounds**  
- 🔁 Convert **Pounds ↔ Ounces**  
- 📊 Shows clear results with instant output  
- 🧭 Simple menu-driven structure for beginners  

---

🛠️ **How It Works (Simple & Clear)**
Once you run the program, it displays a neat **menu** where you can select which conversion you want.  
You enter your choice, input the value, and instantly see the converted result.

It’s based on simple formulas like:
- Grams = Kilograms × 1000  
- Kilograms = Grams ÷ 1000  
- Pounds = Kilograms × 2.20462  
- Ounces = Pounds × 16  

This project uses only **basic C++ features** — `switch-case`, `loops`, and `iostream` —  
making it perfect for anyone new to programming.

📝 **My Journal – Day 11**

Today’s project was surprisingly fun!  
I didn’t just code conversions — I understood how **units relate to each other** mathematically.  

It was satisfying to type a value and instantly get the converted result.  
Step by step, I’m learning how to turn basic math into real working programs.  

Each converter I make teaches me clarity, structure, and patience — things that matter both in code and life.

🚀 **Next Step Ideas**
- 🧮 Add a BMI calculator feature  
- ⚙️ Combine with Temperature and Length Converter into one big system  
- 💾 Save conversion history into a file

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 11/90**, and I’m proud of it.  
It’s not about complexity — it’s about understanding the foundation.  

Each day, I’m realizing how small codes can make life simpler.  
Keep building, keep learning — one project at a time.
