# 🧪 Volume Converter System – Project 13 of 90

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, an 18-year-old CS student working through my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After converting temperature, length, and time — today I wanted to go a bit *deeper* into the concept of measurement.  

So, I built a **Volume Converter System** — a simple C++ program that helps you convert between **liters, milliliters, and gallons**.  
It’s a neat little project that shows how coding can easily turn math into something practical.

---

## 🧩 Overview
This project focuses on **volume conversion**, something we use in cooking, science, and even fuel measurements.  
It helped me practice **switch-case logic**, **loops**, and **mathematical relationships** in a clear and organized structure.  

It’s another step toward mastering the art of building simple, real-world tools with C++.

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- 🔁 Convert **Liters ↔ Milliliters**  
- 🔁 Convert **Liters ↔ Gallons**  
- 🧭 Menu-based interface for beginners  
- 💾 Handles calculations instantly  
- 🎯 Easy to understand and expand later  

---

🛠️ **How It Works (Simple & Clear)**
When you run the program, you’ll see a menu with conversion options.  
After selecting one, you enter the volume value, and the program instantly shows the result.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:
- **1 liter = 1000 milliliters**  
- **1 liter = 0.264172 gallons**  
- **1 gallon = 3.78541 liters**  

These formulas make the system both practical and realistic.

📝 **My Journal – Day 13**

Today’s project reminded me that *precision matters* — whether you’re calculating measurements or writing code.  
It’s amazing how these small programs slowly build a strong foundation.  

The logic may look simple, but every menu option, formula, and structure strengthens my C++ skills.  
Each converter I build feels like a new tool in my digital toolbox 🔧

🚀 **Next Step Ideas**
- 🧱 Add cubic meter and cubic centimeter conversions  
- 💧 Add volume-to-capacity (e.g., tank size estimations)  
- 🧮 Combine all converters into one Mega Conversion System

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 13/90**, and it made me realize that even the smallest things can teach big lessons.  
Coding, like measuring volume, is all about **balance and accuracy**.  

I’ll keep building — one day, one project, one idea at a time.
