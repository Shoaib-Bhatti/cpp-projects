# ✅ To-Do List Manager – Project 8 of 90

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, an 18-year-old CS student currently on my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After building systems like Library Management, Student Management, Car Rental, Quiz Game, and Expense Tracker —  
I wanted to make something that helps me *stay organized every day*.  

So I built a **To-Do List Manager** — a simple system to track, mark, and delete daily tasks.  
Because coding is fun… but consistency is everything 💻  

---

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- ➕ Add new tasks  
- 👀 View all tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- ❌ Delete finished tasks  
- 💾 Automatically save all your tasks in `tasks.txt`  

---

🛠️ **How It Works (Beginner-Friendly Explanation)**
When you start the program, it **loads all saved tasks** from a file.  
Then a **menu system** appears, giving you full control:

- **Add Task:** Type the task name — it gets saved instantly.  
- **View Tasks:** Displays all your pending and done tasks.  
- **Mark Done:** Update your progress anytime.  
- **Delete Task:** Remove any task you no longer need.  
- **Auto Save:** Everything you do is written to `tasks.txt` so you never lose your progress.  

💡 *Behind the scenes:*  
The program uses **structs**, **vectors**, and **file handling** to manage your to-do list, just like a lightweight real-world task manager.

📝 **My Journal – Day 8**

Today I built something simple — but honestly, it feels like a small piece of discipline in code.  
This **To-Do List Manager** reminds me that progress comes one task at a time.  

While making it, I learned how to properly read and write data from files.  
It’s amazing how a few lines of C++ can build something useful for everyday life.  

Every day of this challenge makes me a little better, a little more focused, and a little more confident.  

---

🚀 **Next Step Ideas**
- 📅 Add due dates for each task  
- 🕒 Add timestamps for when tasks were completed  
- 🔍 Add search or filter by status (Pending / Done)  
- 🧠 Add priority levels (Low / Medium / High)  

---

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 8/90**, and it’s one of those small but meaningful builds.  
Not everything has to be complex — sometimes it’s about creating systems that make *you* more consistent.  

Because at the end of the day, every project is a step forward.  
I’m learning, growing, and building something new every single day.
