# 📚 Library Management System – Project 2 of 90  

Hi! My name is **Shoaib Nazar**, I’m a 17-year-old CS student who’s passionate about programming.  
I’ve started a **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**, and this is my **second project**.  
I love documenting my journey — not just to show what I built, but to share how it actually works.

## 🌟 What This System Can Do  
- 📖 **Add & view books**  
- 👥 **Add & view members**  
- 🔄 **Issue & return books**  
- 💾 **Save data separately** (Books / Members / Issued Records)  
- 🔐 **Password-protected saving**  

---

## 🛠️ How the Code Works (Simple Explanation)  
This program is **menu-driven**. When you run it, you’ll see numbered options. Each option leads you to a specific feature.  

- **Adding Books/Members:** The program asks step by step → ID → Name → Other details.  
- **Viewing Data:** It shows all books, members, or issued records stored in memory.  
- **Issuing Books:** First, it shows available books and members, then you choose which member borrows which book.  
- **Returning Books:** You pick which book is being returned.  
- **Saving Data:** You decide whether to save books, members, or issued records. It writes them to text files, but only if you enter the correct password.  

🔧 **Behind the scenes:** Everything is stored in **vectors (dynamic lists in C++)**, and **file handling (ofstream)** is used to save data.

## 📝 My Journal – Day 2  
I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, 17 years old, and honestly, I love doing this.  

Building this project made me realize how important **organization** is in programming.  
Instead of mixing everything in one file, I split the save options — just like a real library would do.  

This is **Project 2 in my 90-day challenge**, and every step makes me feel more confident.  
It’s not just about finishing projects; it’s about learning **real skills** along the way.  

---

## 🚀 What’s Next  
- 🔍 Add **search** (by book title/author/ID)  
- 📅 Add **due dates and fines**  
- 👨‍💼 Add **user roles** (librarian vs. member)

## 🎯 Final Note  
This was **Project 2/90**.  
My goal isn’t **perfection** — it’s **consistency**.  
To show up every day, build something new, and share the process with you.  

If you’re reading this, you’re basically on this journey with me.  
So let’s see where it goes.  

By **Day 90**, I want to look back and say:  
✨ *“Yes, I did it. I built 90 projects in 90 days.”* ✨
