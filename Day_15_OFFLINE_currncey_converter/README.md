# 💱 Currency Converter System – Project 15 of 90  

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, an 18-year-old CS student on my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After creating my BMI Converter yesterday, I wanted to explore something even more practical — something we all use every day without realizing it: **currency conversion**.  

So today, I built a simple yet functional **Currency Converter System** in C++.  
It’s completely **offline**, beginner-friendly, and helps understand how **mathematical conversions** and **menu-driven logic** work together in real-world applications.  

---

## 🧩 Overview  

This system allows you to convert between **multiple major currencies** like **USD, PKR, SAR, AED, GBP, and AUD**.  
It’s perfect for students learning **switch statements**, **loops**, and **basic arithmetic logic** in C++.  

---

## 🌟 Features  

- Convert between **USD ↔ PKR**, **USD ↔ SAR**, **USD ↔ AED**, **USD ↔ GBP**, and **USD ↔ AUD**  
- Uses realistic offline exchange rates  
- Simple menu-driven interface for smooth navigation  
- Designed for absolute beginners who want real-world-style projects  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  

When you run the program, it shows a **menu** with 10 conversion options and one exit option.  
You choose the conversion direction (e.g., USD to PKR), enter the amount, and the system instantly calculates the converted value.  

💡 Example:

1. USD to PKR

2. PKR to USD

3. USD to SAR

After selecting an option, you enter the amount, and the system applies the relevant **conversion rate** using basic arithmetic.  


## 📊 Conversion Rates Used (Offline Example)
| Conversion | Rate |
|-------------|------|
| USD → PKR | 278.45 |
| USD → SAR | 3.75 |
| USD → AED | 3.67 |
| USD → GBP | 0.78 |
| USD → AUD | 1.52 |

## 📝 My Journal – Day 15  

Today I learned that **programming real-life systems** doesn’t always need APIs or internet data.  
Sometimes, even a simple offline logic can give you the **same real-world feel** if you design it thoughtfully.  

This project helped me practice **switch-case structures** and **nested logic**, which are essential for menu-driven programs.  
It was fun to see how fast I could turn an everyday concept into working code.  

Every line I wrote reminded me how much progress I’ve made since Project 1.

## 🚀 Next Step Ideas  

- Connect to a real-time API to fetch live exchange rates  
- Save converted transactions to a file  
- Add a graphical interface for a modern look  

---

## 🎯 Final Note  

This was **Project 15/90**, and it felt incredibly practical.  
Currency might change every day — but what doesn’t change is how you **build your logic** to understand it.  

Each project makes me better, sharper, and more confident in my skills.  
The journey continues — one code, one project, one day at a time.
