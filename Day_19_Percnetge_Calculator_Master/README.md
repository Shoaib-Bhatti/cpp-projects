📊 Percentage Master Tool – Project 19 of 90

> “Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, or algorithms — it’s about understanding.”


🧩 Overview
Day 19 of my 90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge!

Today’s project is the Percentage Master Tool — a smart and interactive C++ program that instantly solves different percentage problems. This tool helps with quick math logic like finding what percent something is or what number a certain percentage represents. 

This project made me realize how even simple math formulas can become super useful digital helpers when coded properly.


⚙️ Features
✨ Calculates “What is X% of Y?”
🧮 Finds “X is what percent of Y?”
🔢 Determines “If X% = Y, then what is 100%?”
♻️ Lets you perform multiple calculations in one run
💡 Gives a clear explanation for every answer


🧠 How It Works
1. The program displays a main menu with 4 options.
2. You choose which type of percentage calculation you want.
3. It takes user input, performs the math using simple arithmetic logic, and prints the result.
4. You can continue doing more calculations or exit anytime.

This Day 19 project helped me practice:
- Using loops (do-while)
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Floating-point math
- Proper result formatting with <iomanip>


🧮 Example Run

==============================
     PERCENTAGE MASTER TOOL
==============================
1. What is X% of Y?
2. X is what percent of Y?
3. If X% = Y, find the total (100%)
4. Exit
------------------------------
Enter your choice (1-4): 1

Enter percentage (X): 25
Enter number (Y): 120

----------------------------------
25% of 120 = 30
Explanation: (25 / 100) × 120 = 30
----------------------------------

Do you want to try another calculation? (y/n): y


🧠 Journal – Day 19
Today I built something practical and smart — the Percentage Master Tool. It’s simple but solves a real-world problem. 
Many people get confused with percentage questions like “What is 18% of 45?” or “20 is what percent of 160?” 
This project gave me the confidence that with small logic, I can make something genuinely helpful.

I learned to control loops, user input, and formatted output more cleanly today. I really enjoyed this one.


🚀 Next Step Ideas
💡 Add a percentage increase/decrease feature.
💡 Include profit, loss, and discount calculators.
💡 Create a GUI version using C++ graphics or Python Tkinter.
💡 Add user history saving option in a text file.


🏁 Final Note
This Day 19 project proved that coding can solve real problems — even small math confusions. 
The more I build, the better I understand logic, flow, and structure.
