# 💰 Expense Tracker System – Project 6 of 90

Hey everyone! I’m **Shoaib Nazar**, a 17-year-old CS student working through my **90 Days, 90 Projects Challenge**.  
After creating systems that manage libraries, students, and cars —  
I wanted to build something more *personal*... something I could actually use every day.  

So I made an **Expense Tracker System** — a simple program that helps you track your daily spending.  
Because let’s be honest — we all wonder where our money goes 😅  

---

🌟 **What This System Can Do**
- ➕ Add daily expenses (with category, amount, note)  
- 👀 View all expenses  
- 💰 Show total spending  
- 🔍 Filter by category (like Food, Transport, etc.)  
- 💾 Save and load data automatically (stored in `expenses.txt`)  

---

🛠️ **How It Works (Simple & Clear)**  
When you start the program, it loads your expense history.  
Then, through a **menu system**, you can perform actions easily:

- **Add Expense:** Enter the date, category, amount, and short note.  
- **View Expenses:** Displays all your spending neatly.  
- **Total Spending:** Calculates how much you’ve spent overall.  
- **Filter by Category:** Shows only Food / Travel / Shopping, etc.  
- **Auto Save:** Every action gets saved in a file for next time.  

💡 *Behind the scenes:*  
The program uses **classes**, **vectors**, and **file handling** — the same tools real finance trackers use, just simpler.

📝 **My Journal – Day 6**

Today I wanted to create something useful — not just another system, but something that helps *me*.  
So I made this Expense Tracker 💸  

Typing my own daily expenses and seeing the total grow was kind of satisfying (and scary 😂).  
But it made me realize how simple tools can create real awareness.  

I’m starting to understand how to manage data properly — store, read, calculate, and filter.  
It’s not about complexity — it’s about **clarity**.  

Every project makes me more confident in using C++ for real-world tasks.

🚀 **Next Step Ideas**
- 📊 Add monthly total spending  
- 📈 Show category-wise bar graph  
- 🔐 Add password protection for personal use

🎯 **Final Note**
This was **Project 6/90**, and I’m proud of it.  
Because it’s something that connects logic with real life.  

Building this showed me how programming isn’t just about code — it’s about **solving your own problems**.  
Step by step, day by day, line by line — I’m getting better 💻✨
